# Description:
I want a small program tp locate my repository
I want to work on and take me there. It should also prevent 
from errors.

Step-1
First we locate our repository using the build-in
linux command "find".

Step-2:
Take input as $1 to locate a specific repository. 
If there is no input, we will print out error message.

Step-3:
We will save the output of the find command
and "change the directory".

Step-4:
Before the bash process is eliminated, we take over.
