#Description:
Every project we work on will be stored in our GitHub account.
Everytime we want to publish our source code, we have a repeated block of code we want to speed up. So this script will help us do exactly that.

Psuedo Code:

Check if the current directory is a git directory.
If [current dir is a repository]; then publish your code to git hub.
else 
  give error message about the current dir.
  ask to user about the desired repository.
  
fi

Addition:
1- find repository
2- configure GitHub
